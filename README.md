#  RSA-Algorithm Encryption/Decryption
###### This **RSA Algorithm** was written using Python.
This implementation of ***RSA Algorithm***  provides users with the ability to generate public and private keys since it is an
asymmetrical algorithm.
By asymmetrical I mean that we use two different keys for encryption and decryption of the message. 
The public key is shared ***publicly***, but the private key is kept ___confindential___. With this code, users can generate their
prime numbers which leads to calculating their other components which help with encryption and decryption.
